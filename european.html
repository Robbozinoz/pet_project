                                and when required. </p>
                            <p>Take them out on a defrost on a day where you know we are running around and will not have the time to make a meal when you get back home.</p>

                                <li>500gms beef mince</li>
                                <li>500gms pork/veal mince</li>
                                <li>1 large onion or 2 small very finely chopped or blended in food processor/blender(I blend the onions and parsley at the same time to save myself time)</li>
                                <li>handful of breadcrumbs(panko crumbs from supermarket are fine)</li>
                                <li>handful of grated parmesan cheese</li>
                                <li>half a handful of chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
                                <li>1 egg</li>
                                <li>salt and pepper</li>
                                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Method</h3>
                            <!--Comments from John - If you need to put extra steps in, copy and paste the <h4></h4> symbols and number the step as you need it.-->
                            <h4>Step One</h4>
                            <p>Place mince in large bowl.Add onion, egg, parsley and parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine. If mixture is too wet add more breadcrumbs, if too dry add a bit more of egg beaten.</p>
                            <h4>Step Two</h4>mixture is
                            <p>Roll mixture into balls around the size of a walnut using damp hands if making meatballs or shape into burger patties if making burgers . Place on a plate.</p>
                            <h4>Step Three</h4>
                            <p>Put Plate into fridge and allow to sit for as long as you can, even 30 minutes will help them to hold when frying, or if you want and are very organised overnight if covered in clingfilm.</p>
                            <h4>Step Four</h4>
                            <p>Once you are ready to fry your meatballs or burgers put Olive Oil into a large shallow frying pan and heat. Once oil is hot add meat mixture and shallow fry until brown on each side - do not crowd the pan or they will not brown
                                and ensure to turn meatballs frequently to stop burning. </p>
                            <h4>Step Five</h4>
                            <p>If making burgers you are done. Add to roll and serve with your accompaniments. If you are making meatballs I would advise that you use the Tomato Sauce receipe(see website) and once browned pop the meatballs in the sauce for
                                about 30 minutes and serve with pasta of your choice(mine is egg tagliatellie) topped with Basil and Parmesan Cheese.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The promise of homemade Chicken Schnitzel can work as a bargaining tool with my kids(more often than not homemade chips are also included). They are pretty easy to make and can be made in advance and left in the fridge until ready
                            to fry, and are brilliant in sandwiches the next day.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Ingredients - serves 4</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 large or 3 small chicken breasts</li>
                            <li>2 eggs beaten with splash of milk added</li>
                            <li>150-200gms of breadcrumbs(about 2 cups - I prefer to use Panko Breadcrumbs as they make the schnitzel very crispy)</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp of Italian seasoning or mixed herbs</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp of Garlic salt</li>
                            <li>1 tsp smoked Paprika</li>
                            <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan Cheese( I buy the ready grated bag from supermarket)</li>
                            <li>Salt and Pepper for seasoning</li>
                            <li>3 tbln Oil for frying</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Method</h3>
                        <h4>Step One</h4>
                        <p>Put the chicken breast between 2 pieces of clingfilm and using a meat mallet or rolling pin pound the chichen breast until flat(be careful not to pound too much). Cut the schnitzel into portions </p>
                        <h4>Step Two</h4>
                        <p>Put the egg into a large shallow bowl( I use Ikea pasta bowls) and loosely beat - add a splash of milk just to loosen further</p>
                        <h4>Step Three</h4>
                        <p>Into another large shallow bowl add the all the other dry ingredients and mix</p>
                        <h4>Step Four</h4>
                        <p>Take the flattened chicken breast and dip into the egg mixture, allow excess to run off before placing in breadcrumb mixture and pat down to ensure that all parts of chicken is covered with mixture. Remove from mixture and place
                            on plate to be put in the fridge until you are ready to fry the chicken.</p>
                        <h4>Step Five</h4>
                        <p>Heat about 2 tbsp of oil in large frying pan and add chicken - do not overcrowd the pan as this will mean that the chicken will not go crispy - you may need to keep topping up the oil as you go. Once the chicken is cooked remove
                            from pan onto paper towel to drain excess oil and then keep warm unitl serving ( I usually put the oven on about 160 degrees to keep the chicken warm as I cook).</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Tips</h4>
                        <p>When I have time I serve with homemade chips but if not salad is always a good option to serve with this dish.</p>
