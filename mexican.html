                        <p>This dish always amazes my husband that so little goes into making a really tasty dish. This is one of theses dishes I will put on between getting home from work and taking children to sporting activities after school(I just turn
                            the heat in the oven down if I know I will be away for over an hour).</p>
                        <p> If you are not sure what Chipotle Chilles in Adobo Sauce or Mexican Oregano is please read quick explanation on website.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 tbs Olive Oil</li>
                            <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
                            <li>2 large brown onions slice into half rings</li>
                            <li>2 dried Chipotle chillies soaked for an hour in water then chopped into large chunks or 2 chipotle chillies in adobo sauce from can</li>
                            <li>100 ml of chicken stock</li>
                            <li>tbs of dried mexican oregano if available or dried thyme</li>
                            <li>salt and pepper</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Method</h3>
                        <!--Comments from John - If you need to put extra steps in, copy and paste the <h4></h4> symbols and number the step as you need it.-->
                        <h4>Step One</h4>
                        <p>Blend the Chipotle chilles and chicken stock together - this can be done well in advance if you are organised.</p>
                        <h4>Step Two</h4>
                        <p>Heat your oven to 180 degrees Centigrade </p>
                        <h4>Step Three</h4>
                        <p>In dutch oven(because I have one) or oven proof dish gently fry onions until slightly brown on edges, around 10 minutes.</p>
                        <h4>Step Four</h4>
                        <p>Place chicken on top of onions and pour over sauce.</p>
                        <h4>Step Five</h4>
                        <p>Sprinkle with the dried herbs and place in oven for about 35-45 minutes ensuring that the chicken is properly cooked.</p>
                        <h4>Tips</h4>
                        <p>I serve this with Mexican Black Beans(see website), cabbage and coriander salad(see below) and avacado.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Any leftovers are great in a toasted sandwich the next day with cheese and corn and red onion.</p>

                        <p>Chilli Con Carne is a great thing to make and just leave bubbling slowly on the stove as you go about your day knowing that dinner is taking care of itself. Little hassle goes into making a very tasty meal</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 tbs of flavourless oil</li>
                            <li>500 gms of minced beef</li>
                            <li>1 large onion finely chopped</li>
                            <li>2 cloves of garlic finely chopped or a tbs of minced garlic from jar</li>
                            <li>1 tsp of ground cumin</li>
                            <li>2 red peppers/capsicum finely chopped</li>
                            <li>1 courgette/zucchini finely chopped</li>
                            <li>2 finely chopped fresh chillies or 1 chipotle chilli in adobo seasoning chopped with some sauce - this is a rough guide dependant on how hot you like your chilli you can control how many chillies that you add</li>
                            <li>400gm tin of diced tomatoes</li>
                            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                            <li>1 tin of red kidney beans'</li>
                            <li>1 tin of black beans'</li>
                            <li>handful of chopped coriander leaves and finely chopped stalks</li>
                            <li>1-2 limes squeezed to taste</li>
                            <li>salt</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Method</h3>
                        <h4>Step One</h4>
                        <p>Heat up Olive Oil in heavy bottom pan and add onion, garlic and cumin. Stir and cook over a medium heat until onions are soft add the peppers, courgette and chillies and cook for a further 5 minutes.</p>
                        <h4>Step Two</h4>
                        <p>Add the beef and break up any big chunks with back of wooden spoon , frying until beef is browned.</p>
                        <h4>Step Three</h4>
                        <p>Add the tomatoes and cinnamon stick stir and turn the heat down to low - allow this to simmer for about an hour to hour and half, stirring occasionally if you are around.</p>
                        <h4>Step Four</h4>
                        <p>Drain and rinse the beans and add to the chilli along with the finely chopped coriander stalks- leave for another 30 minutes to hour.</p>
                        <h4>Step Five</h4>
                        <p>Remove the chilli from the heat and add lime juice to taste and the coriander leaves reserving a small amount to sprinkle over chilli once on plate. Once happy with balance of flavour serve to your hungry hoarde.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Tips</h4>
                        <p>I serve this with fluffy white rice, avacado and natural yoghurt as a side for those who cannot deal with the heat (i.e my daughter and myself). This Chilli is also good warmed up in wraps the next day with grated cheese, sweetcorn
                            and yoghurt.</p>

                        <p>So, when I am making mexican meals and do not have time to soak and rehyrdate dried Chipotle Chillies(or haven't had time to go to the one shop that I know sells them), I reach for a can of Chipotles in Adobo Sauce.</p>
                        <p>But what is this? and why should we use them? </p>
                        <p>Well - Chipotles are small peppers(most common Jalapenos) that have been dried and smoked and then rehydrated and canned in a puree of tomato, vinegar, garlic and other spices. </p>
                        <p>I use them for many recipes - they are great if you want add a smoky element to a dish, you need to add some heat(if you don't want too much then scrape the seeds from the chilli prior to using). Mix it through Mayonnaise to make
                            a spicy mayo. Marinade meat in it or add to sauces.</p>
                        <p>Another great thing about this can is that it keeps forever in the pantry(well maybe not quite but nearly) and once opened can be stored in the fridge for weeks or using an icecube tray blitz up can and freeze in blocks using only
                            when needed. Genius!!</p>
                        <p>The most common ways that I use this magic ingredient is in Chilli Con Carne for heat and smoky flavour or Chipotle Chicken( no prizes for guessing why)</p>
                        <p>Buying this ingredient is now much easier many of the major supermarkets will stock one of Chipoltles in Adobo Sauce so just a matter of picking it off the shelf when doing your shop and starting to experiment!</p>

                        <p>There are 2 different types of Oregano with 2 very different tastes - Mexican Oregano and Eurpoean Orgeano.</p>
                        <p>European Orgeano is actually a member of the mint family! European Oregano grows through Greece, Spain, Italy, Egypt and Turkey. This herb is sometimes labelled as Wild Marjoram. There can be distinct difference in taste throughout
                            the regions - Greek Oregano is very earthy whereas the Italian is milder(think pizza herb )</p>
                        <p>Mexican Orgeano is actually a relative of Lemon Verbena and is native to Mexico, it also grows through Central and South America. It has a very different taste and smell to it's European couterpart - much more citrus with mild
                            licorice.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have only ever been able to find the dried variety where I live, but find that it works really well with the Latin American/Tex Mex dishes that I make well worth investing in if you come aross it as a little goes a long way.</p>

                        <p> So in my house I have a teenager who is averse to most green vegetables. They are looked at with distain and eaten under duress, but this salad seems to tick all the boxes and she loves it(even if the colour is predominantley green!).</p>
                        <p>This recipe comes from an old cookbook that my Mum gave me about 25 years ago.</p>
